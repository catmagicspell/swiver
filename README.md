**swiver** is a PSP homebrew that allows you to switch (spoof) your PSP's current version.txt to any version's **(1.00-6.61)** version.txt automatically.<br> 
It can be used to fix the "The system version of your PSPâ„¢ system version is 9.90. There is no need to update" issue on 5.50 CFW.<br> 
It also takes a backup of your original version.txt so if something goes wrong for some reason, you can just rerun the program and restore the backup easily.<br>
